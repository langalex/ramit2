# Ramit 2

This is a rewrite of https://github.com/langalex/ramit using SvelteKit and PouchDB.

Ramit is a personal accounting app inspried by the book 'I will teach you to be rich' by Ramit Sethi.

It is based on the idea that for each area of spending you preload an account with money and only spend as much of it as you have in that account.
