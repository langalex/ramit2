- this project uses bun as runtime/package manager
- this project uses SvelteKit / Svelte 5. Don't generate code for earlier Svelte versions. Use runes.

# Testing

- run unit tests with `bun vitest run <file>`
- when generating new code, always add unit tests
- when creating a \*.svelte.test.ts file, remove the leading `+` from the filename
